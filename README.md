Hello! 
My name is Kirsten and I'm looking into a career change towards web development. 
I majored in Biological Sciences at the University of Illinois and currently work as a chemist.

I don't have a lot of experience in coding, but everyday I am taking it one day at a time in hopes of becoming a full stack developer if not a front end developer.

Creativity has always been my strong suit and I'm hoping that with a little extra conviction and self teaching, I can break into the field! 
Wish me luck!

6/4/2021: I learned to create repositories and upload my own content. I moved my HTML/CSS FCC project onto Github to try and start building my resume. Took a little longer than I imagined, but that was my own doing as I kept taking a lot of breaks. Oops!
